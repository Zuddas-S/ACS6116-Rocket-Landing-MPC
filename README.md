# ACS6116---Rocket-Landing-MPC-
An assignment set for the ACS6116 - Advanced Control module. The assignment focussed on modelling and controlling a Falcon 9 rocket during landing, using constrained and unconstrained model predictive control (MPC) techniques. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an advanced control technique where inputs are recalculated every time step, based on an optimal control procedure. This work aimed to bridge the gap between theoretical control concepts and their application in managing the complex dynamics of a rocketâ€™s descent. The essence of the project was to ensure precision and stability in the landing phase, a challenge that addressed the rocket landing problem using advanced control techniques.

## The Objective 
Model a point mass rocket, and land it at the coordinates $\vec r(k_f)=(0, 0, 0)$.

## MPC Setup & Unconstrained Optimisation



I started with the conception of an unconstrained MPC controller. Here, I focused on selecting the appropriate Q and R matrices, emphasizing the significance of vertical position and velocity to avoid hard landings, while treating control efforts, such as fuel consumption, with less priority. This initial phase laid the groundwork, allowing me to establish a baseline control strategy.
